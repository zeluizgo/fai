Presentation and MSAccess file about the "Sherlock" which was an implementation of a survey/research system for sales force diagnostics made in 2009.

## Welcome to my github samples code - FAI

FAI is the joint venture with Americanas (a retail saler in Brazil) and Itau (a retail bank in Brazil) and means Financeira Americanas Itau. 
In a business research area connected with sales force management called Telemetry, I've made this tool which implements in MSAcces connected with MSSQLServer an engine which implements a dynamic survey/research tool.

Unfortunately, I didn't found the codes from the database scripts either the VBA code behind the MSAccess attached here. 
BUt I found this powerpoint presentation which brings the all the concept with enough printscreens. It marks in 2009 the moment for a business analysts where a powerpoit turns more important than the code itself.

So I've just upload these two files:

1. Sherlock Telemetria Fai_v2.pptx - The powerpoint presentation (did at same time when I was coding) explaining all the concepts behind the implementation.
2. Nova Ferramenta.accdb - MSAcces with the front-end implementation and script calls to the Scherlock database. (Maybe I can extract the VBAs from this in a future).
3. Dispersao - an example of report automatic made from VBA in FAI.

The VBA codes in MSAccess and MSExcel was used for me in a lot of automation since 2005 to 2010 in my work as a business analyst in Unibanco.
